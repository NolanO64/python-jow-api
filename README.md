# Jow API

This is a Python package that allows you to search for recipes on [Jow.fr](https://Jow.fr). The package provides an easy-to-use interface to search for recipes and fetch information about them.

## Installation

You can install the package using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) : 

```bash
pip install python-jow-api
```

## Usage
The package provides convenient functions for searching and obtaining recipe information. Here's an example:

```python
from jow_api import Jow

recipes_json = Jow.api_call("poulet rôti",40)
recipe_dict = Jow.get_all(recipes_json)

print(recipe_dict)

```
The `api_call` function takes a search query as input, with an optional limit parameter,  and returns the raw JSON response from the Jow.fr API. To obtain the recipe data in a more readable format, you can use the `get` or `get_all` methods of the Jow class provided by the package.

The get_all method takes the raw JSON response from the api_call function as input and returns a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a recipe. Each recipe dictionary contains the following keys :


* `id` : The ID of the recipe.
* `name` : The name of the recipe.
* `url` : The URL of the recipe on Jow.fr.
* `ingredients` : A list of dictionaries where each dictionary corresponds to an ingredient used in the recipe and contains the following keys:
    * `name` : The name of the ingredient.
    * `quantity` : The quantity of the ingredient needed for the recipe.
    * `unit` : The unit of measurement for the quantity of the ingredient.
    * `isOptional` : A boolean value indicating whether the ingredient is optional or not.
